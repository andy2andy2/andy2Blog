After 4 months, I have setup Jekyll hosted on Github. Jekyll is an open source static site generator created in Ruby.
It does not require a database, so it has easy upkeep and is lightweight. It is heavily supported with Github and can host for free,
this was my main attraction to it. I initially started with AWS and an OS that had a bitnami Wordpress image installed. After trying to configure the DB aspect,
losing the admin creds, and realizing I had to pay. I looked for an alternative, I stumbled with this right here blog. I wanted something that was easy, free, and
most important ready to go!

This project took longer than I would like to admit. I took a long break and wanted to knock it out this new year. I had 3 itterations, 1 test, and 2 attempts.
The test worked like a charm, I even hosted it on github.io and linked my domain name. I loosely followed the [Giraffe Academy's] playlist and managed to get everything working.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&ab_channel=GiraffeAcademy)
However it was just to see how it worked, I knew that I could add a theme, wanted it to have my resume, and categories for my project, thoughts, and notes.

My second attempt I am not exactly sure when it went wrong but I think I know where it went wrong.
I failed migration, where I changed the name of the folder structure and I think I deleted some of the internal folders. It caused errors that I could not understandhow to fix. I stepped away from this project for a good 2 months. I took a break from computers in general, got back into landscape, and did some soul searching.

Here on my successfull attempt, I attempted to go back to it. Uninstalled and reinstalled Jekyll and picked a new theme that is called Minimal Mistakes. 
On the Minimal Mistakes documentation, I learned about the different methods

##Gem-based method
With Gem-based themes, directories such as the assets, _layouts, _includes, and _sass are stored in the theme’s gem, hidden from your immediate view. This allows for easier installation and updating as you don’t have to manage any of the theme files.

##Remote Theme Method
Remote themes are similar to Gem-based themes, but do not require Gemfile changes or whitelisting making them ideal for sites hosted with GitHub Pages.

As per Minimal Mistakes

I went through with the Remote Theme, it took a bit of configuring, but it is up and running.

I realized that I had to update Jekyll to make this theme work. Something so small and important. This will be the very first detail I look into when working on a project is the compatiability and version of all the software involved. I am currently working on a Udemy course that is a 4 years behind, and as I am working thru the VM, some of the tools are not working as they should. 

My next step in all this is consistently creating blog post, I am shooting to create a new blog post once a week with a book review/notes, or notes on skills . As well as once a month project showcases.
